# Make-America-Swole-Again


## Welcome to M.A.S.A

Before launching into our code, we request that you install the following: 

```
npm install
```

and 

```
bower install 
```

Start up the Express server on port 8080 with npm start.

## Our Motivation

You think this is another workout app? 

WRONG!

We wanted to create an app that inspires and tracks user's progress as they hit the gym to become so swole. Not only did we want to make an app that was appealing to the eye, but also helpful on the user's path to being as strong and healthy as they can be. 

Y'all it's going to be YUGE! And even more important, so are you!
